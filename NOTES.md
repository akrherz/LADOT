===========
Conference call with Heitzman, Takle, and me

 - I should write up the method by which the random periods are meshed together
   for inclusion in the final report
 - Heitzman will provide me with how he wants these various scenarios ordered,
   I then have a month to get that done.
 - Should start working on a draft of the final report
 - MS is still interested in updating their historical files, but Heitzman has
   not finalized that
 - Want to arrange a teleconn with LADOT on the 24th
 - Still a question on how best to arrange the station file with all these
   various scenarios.  Heitzman suggests different directories for each
 - Heitzman mentioned that MEPG is old software now, should look into the new
   format and see how difficult it is...
